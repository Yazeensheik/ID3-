# ID3-
ID3 Decision Tree Algorithm
# Tennis Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the `Playtennis.csv` dataset using the ID3 algorithm implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `ID3.ipynb`. The goal is to predict whether a tennis match will be played based on various weather conditions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to use the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree that predicts whether a tennis match will be played given certain weather conditions. The decision tree model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, and the dataset used for training and testing is `Playtennis.csv`.

## Dataset

The `Playtennis.csv` file contains the following columns:

- Outlook: Weather outlook (Sunny, Overcast, Rain)
- Temperature: Temperature (Hot, Mild, Cool)
- Humidity: Humidity level (High, Normal)
- Windy: Wind conditions (True, False)
- PlayTennis: Target variable indicating whether a tennis match is played (Yes, No)

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
